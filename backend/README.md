# Gottado

Gottado (provisional name) is a todo app that is meant to help you create processes.

Sometimes when trying to get a repetitive task done we might skip a step, forget about something trivial, or simply not realize what really is needed.
The idea for this app is to help you create said processes by organizing into tasks or group of tasks.

This app is not revolutionary. I just want to create it from scratch to see what happens.
